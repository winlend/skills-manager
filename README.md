## Features

- **Unified skill library** — Install skills from Git repos, local folders, `.zip` / `.skill` archives, or the [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) marketplace. Everything goes into one central repo, which defaults to `~/.skills-manager` and can be customized in **Settings**.
- **Marketplace + AI search** — Browse popular skills from the marketplace, run keyword search, or enable SkillsMP AI search with your API key.
- **Presets** — Group skills into named presets. In any workspace, click a preset pill to instantly activate or deactivate all its skills for the current agent scope. The sidebar lists all presets for quick access.
- **Global Workspace** — Each agent gets its own page listing every skill in its global folder — including ones installed outside Skills Manager — so the view always reflects what the agent actually sees. Add or remove skills per agent, or use the All Agents overview to manage every installed agent at once.
- **Project Workspaces** — View and manage project-local skill folders for supported agents, compare them with your central library, and sync changes in either direction. Supports nested skill directories and per-agent assignment when exporting.
- **Linked Workspaces** — Point to any directory as a skills root — useful for skills that live outside the default agent paths. Managed as a standalone workspace without participating in global preset sync.
- **Multi-tool sync** — Sync skills to any supported tool via symlink or copy with a single click. Every skill card shows an agent icon badge per enabled agent — click a badge to install or remove that skill for that agent right from the card, with the badge reflecting live sync state.
- **Add from Library sheet** — In any workspace, click **+ Add Skills** to open a unified picker: search your central library, toggle target agents with always-visible chips (with select-all/clear), and batch-add multiple skills in one click.
- **Batch operations** — Multi-select skills for bulk enable/disable, export, or delete. Project Workspaces also support bulk enable/disable for project-local skills.
- **Skill tagging and filters** — Tag skills, use tags to group similar skills, and filter by source or tag — including an **Untagged** pill to quickly find skills missing labels.
- **Update tracking** — Check for upstream updates on Git-based skills; re-import local ones.
- **Skill preview and source inspection** — Read `SKILL.md` / `README.md`, inspect source metadata, and compare local content with the upstream version inside the app.
- **Custom tools** — Add your own agents/tools with custom skills directories, or override the default path for any built-in tool.
- **Git backup and restore** — Version-control your skill library with Git for backup and multi-machine sync, then restore snapshot versions from Version History when needed.
- **Activity log & Export Logs** — Install / remove / update / sync operations are recorded locally. Use **Settings → Export Logs** to bundle recent logs and activity history into a single zip for easier issue reports.
- **Flexible app settings** — Configure repo path, sync mode, theme, text size, language, tray behavior, proxy, Git remote, update checks, and the order agents appear throughout the app — all in one place.

## Core Concepts

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/diagram-concept-map.png" width="640" alt="Concept map: Library, Preset, Global Workspace, Project Workspace, Agent" />
</p>

- **Presets are reusable skill groups** — A preset is a named collection of skills. Activate a preset in any workspace to add all its skills to the selected agents; deactivate to remove them. Applying a preset is a one-time copy — not a live sync.
- **Global Workspace manages per-agent global skills** — Each installed agent has its own global skills folder (e.g. `~/.claude/skills/` for Claude Code). Each agent page lists everything in that folder — even skills installed without Skills Manager — so you can add, remove, or adopt them; the All Agents overview manages every agent at once.
- **Project Workspaces are project-local skill sets** — A project workspace manages the skills that live inside a specific project (e.g. `<project>/.claude/skills/`). Skills added here only apply to that project.
- **Tags are for grouping and filtering** — Use tags to label similar skills, then filter by tag to find the subset you want quickly.
- **Batch control works everywhere** — Multi-select skills in any workspace for bulk operations.

## Quick Start

1. Install skills from local folders, Git repositories, archives, or the marketplace. If you have a SkillsMP API key, you can also turn on AI search.
2. Open **Global Workspace** from the sidebar and pick an agent (e.g. Claude Code).
3. Click a **Preset** pill to activate its skills for that agent, or use **+ Add Skills** to pick from your library and toggle target agents inline. Active presets show a ✓; partial installs show a count badge.
4. To manage project-local skills, open a **Project Workspace** and use the same preset pills or the **+ Add Skills** picker with its multi-agent target selector.
5. Configure agent paths, custom tools, theme, language, proxy, and Git preferences in **Settings**.
6. If you want history or multi-machine sync, set a Git remote in **Settings** and run **Start Backup** or **Sync to Git** from the **Library**.

## Git Backup

Back up the `skills/` folder inside your current central repository to a Git repo for version history and multi-machine sync. By default this is `~/.skills-manager/skills/`.

### Quick setup

1. Create a private repository (recommended).
2. Open **Settings → Git Sync Configuration** and save your remote URL.
3. Open **Library**.
4. Choose one:
- Existing remote: click **Start Backup** to clone from the configured remote.
- New local repo: click **Start Backup** to initialize locally, then use **Sync to Git**.
5. Use **Sync to Git** from the Library toolbar.

`Sync to Git` automatically handles pull, commit, and push based on current repo status.
Each successful sync creates a snapshot version tag. You can open **Version History** in the **Library**, inspect the timeline, and restore any snapshot as a new commit.

### Authentication

- SSH URL (`git@github.com:...`): requires SSH key configured on your machine and added to GitHub.
- HTTPS URL (`https://github.com/...`): push usually requires a Personal Access Token (PAT).

> **Note:** The SQLite database (`skills-manager.db` inside your current central repository, `~/.skills-manager/skills-manager.db` by default) is not included in Git — it stores metadata that can be rebuilt by scanning the skill files.

## Supported Tools

Cursor · Claude Code · Codex · Grok · OpenCode · Amp · Kilo Code · Roo Code · Goose · Gemini CLI · GitHub Copilot · Windsurf · TRAE IDE · Antigravity · Clawdbot · Droid

You can also add custom tools in **Settings** and manage their skills the same way.

## In-App Help

The **Help** button in **Settings** mirrors the current product flow: recommended workflows, presets, skill installation, the Library (with the Untagged filter and per-card delete), the Global Workspace and the **+ Add Skills** sheet, Project Workspaces with the multi-agent target picker, Git backup, and environment-level settings (including Export Logs for issue reports). It is intended as the in-app version of this quick-start guide.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Tech |
|-------|------|
| Frontend | React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS |
| Desktop | Tauri 2 |
| Backend | Rust |
| Storage | SQLite (`rusqlite`) |
| i18n | react-i18next |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Rust toolchain
- [Tauri prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) for your OS

### Development

```bash
npm install
npm run tauri:dev
```

### CLI

The repository includes an agent-friendly CLI built on the same Rust shared core used by the desktop app. Both the CLI and the desktop app go through the same SQLite database, central library, and sync engine.

```bash
# Repository / library overview
npm run cli -- repo status
npm run cli -- skills list
npm run cli -- skills show db

# Install skills (default: enter library only — does NOT sync to agents)
npm run cli -- skills install ./my-skill                       # local path
npm run cli -- skills install https://github.com/foo/bar.git   # git URL
npm run cli -- skills install vercel-labs/agent-skills@react-best-practices  # skills.sh
npm run cli -- skills install foo/bar --sync                   # add to active preset + sync to agents

# Update / check from upstream (git skills re-clone, local skills re-import source)
npm run cli -- skills update --all
npm run cli -- skills check --all

# Search the skills.sh marketplace (no API key needed)
npm run cli -- skills search react --limit 5

# Remove (--yes required; --dry-run available)
npm run cli -- skills remove <ref> --dry-run
npm run cli -- skills remove <ref> --yes

# Enable / disable skills by changing preset membership
npm run cli -- presets add-skill <preset> <ref>
npm run cli -- presets remove-skill <preset> <ref>

# Sync the active preset out to enabled agents
npm run cli -- skills sync --dry-run
npm run cli -- skills sync --tool claude_code

# Adopt skills that already exist in an agent directory (e.g. ~/.claude/skills/)
npm run cli -- skills adopt ~/.claude/skills --dry-run
npm run cli -- skills adopt ~/.claude/skills

# Tag
npm run cli -- skills tag add <ref> web frontend
npm run cli -- skills tag list

# Presets
npm run cli -- presets list
npm run cli -- presets preview Default
npm run cli -- presets apply Default
npm run cli -- presets add-skill <preset> <skill>
npm run cli -- presets remove-skill <preset> <skill>

# Export one skill to an arbitrary directory (one-shot copy, not managed)
npm run cli -- skills export db --dest ~/.claude/skills/db

# Git-backed skills repo
npm run cli -- git status
npm run cli -- git pull
npm run cli -- git commit -m "chore: update skills"
```

Available command groups:
- `repo` — inspect or change the configured base directory
- `tools` — list detected tool targets and paths
- `skills` — manage skills in the central library (`list / show / install / update / check / remove / enable / disable / sync / search / adopt / tag / export`)
- `presets` — list presets, preview / apply, add or remove skills from a preset
- `git` — operate on the git-backed `skills/` repository (`clone`, `pull`, `push`, `commit`, `versions`, `restore`)

Extra flags:
- `--skills-root <path>` — operate on a cloned/exported skills repo directly instead of the local app default. The manager's state (DB, presets, cache, logs) lives in `~/.skills-manager/external/<name>-<hash>/`, namespaced by the canonical path of the skills root, so the external checkout itself stays clean.
- `--json` — machine-readable output for scripts/agents

```bash
npm run -s cli -- --skills-root /path/to/my-skills --json skills list
```

#### Install the binary on PATH

Agents and scripts that invoke `skills-manager-cli` directly (without `npm run`) need the binary on PATH. Install it with:

```bash
npm run cli:install
# equivalent to:
# cargo install --path src-tauri --bin skills-manager-cli --locked --force
```

This drops the binary at `~/.cargo/bin/skills-manager-cli`. Re-run after pulling updates to refresh it.

#### Concurrent use with the desktop app

The CLI and desktop app share the same SQLite database. SQLite serializes writes safely, but the running app does not auto-refresh its in-memory caches when the CLI mutates state — restart or trigger a manual refresh in the app after `presets apply`, `git pull`, or other CLI write operations.

### Build

```bash
npm run tauri:build
npm run cli:build
```

## Troubleshooting

### macOS: Gatekeeper blocks the app on first launch

Skills Manager is ad-hoc signed but not notarized (no paid Apple Developer ID), so macOS Gatekeeper will warn the first time you open it.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/CleanShot_20260530_093302@2x.png" width="320" alt="macOS Gatekeeper warning: Apple could not verify skills-manager.app is free of malware" />
</p>

- **"Apple could not verify … is free of malware"** or **"App can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer"** (releases from v1.20.0 onward) — On macOS 15 (Sequoia) the dialog above only offers **Move to Trash** / **Done**: click **Done**, then open **System Settings → Privacy & Security** and click **Open Anyway** (it appears after the first blocked launch). On older macOS you can instead right-click the app in Finder and choose **Open**, then confirm in the dialog.
- **"App is damaged and can't be opened"** (releases up to and including v1.19.0) — Run this in Terminal, then open the app again:

  ```bash
  xattr -cr /Applications/skills-manager.app
  ```

  Replace the path with wherever you placed the `.app` file if it's not in `/Applications`.
